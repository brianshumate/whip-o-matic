**whip-o-matic** generates randomized phrases derived from a corpus
derived from the song lyrics of the late
[Wesley Willis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Willis).

Code based on [WTF Engine](https://github.com/soulwire/WTFEngine), and
created because I am a fan of Wesley Willis' music and visual art;
the combinations which appear in the phrases are sometimes hilarious
(*caution*: they're also NSFW and can be obscene).
