**whip-o-matic** generates randomized phrases derived from a corpus of words
taken from the song lyrics of the late
[Wesley Willis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Willis).

The code is based on [WTF Engine](https://github.com/soulwire/WTFEngine).

I created this because I am a fan of Wesley Willis' music and visual art, and
the combinations which appear in the phrases are sometimes hilarious
(*caution*: they're also NSFW and quite obscene sometimes).
