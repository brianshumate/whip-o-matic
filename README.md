# whip-o-matic

The whip-o-matic generates randomized phrases derived from a corpus of words
taken from the song lyrics of the late [Wesley Willis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Willis).

The code is based on [WTF Engine](https://github.com/soulwire/WTFEngine).

I created this because I am a fan of Wesley Willis' music and visual art, and
the combinations which appear in the phrases are sometimes hilarious.
